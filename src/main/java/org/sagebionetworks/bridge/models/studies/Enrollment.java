/**
 * Represents the enrollment of a participant in a study. Enrollment in the Bridge sense 
 * is a little broader than active enrollment in a study. An enrollment record can be 
 * created as soon as an account is being tracked in a study (e.g. an account is created 
 * with an external ID, which is always associated to a study), and the record will 
 * continue to exist if the user withdraws. However, it is not a complete history of 
 * consent activity; that continues to be recorded in the user's consent history and 
 * consent signatures. This record only records the current state of the account.
